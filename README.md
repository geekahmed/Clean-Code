# Chapter 1. Introduction
- This Book is about good programming. It's about how to write good code, and how to transform bad code into good code.
- The code represents the detail of the requirements and the details cannot be ignored or abstracted. We may create languages that are closer to the requirements. We can create tools that help us parse and assemble those requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision.
- Procrastination cleaning your code may be a trap to LeBlanc's Law.
	- Later equals never.
- As the mess builds, the productivity of the team continues to decrease, asymptotically approaching zero.
- Itâ€™s not enough to write the code well. The code has to be kept clean over time. We have all seen code rot and degrade as time passes. So we must take an active role in preventing this degradation.
- Each experimented programmer has his/her own definition of clean code, but something is clear, a clean code is a code that you can read easily. The clean code is code that has been taken care of.
